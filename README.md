LLM-Based Engagement Classification in Human-Robot Interaction
This repository provides code for engagement classification in human-robot interaction (HRI) using Large Language Models (LLMs). The dataset consists of human movement, emotion, and cognitive features collected from video recordings of object handover interactions. The model classifies engagement levels into low, middle, or high using structured prompting.
